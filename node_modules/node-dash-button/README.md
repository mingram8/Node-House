Place it. *Hack it.* Press it. ~~Get it.~~

This module was inspired by [this fantastic article by Edward Bensen](https://medium.com/@edwardbenson/how-i-hacked-amazon-s-5-wifi-button-to-track-baby-data-794214b0bdd8).

It is a simple library that will allow you to utilize a dash button to emit an event.  I am using the same strategy of watching for dash generated ARP requests as the article above.

#### Installation Instructions
The following should work for ubuntu, the main thing for any os is getting the libpcap dependancy.
``` sh
# dependancy on libpcap for reading packets
$ sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
$ npm install node-dash-button 
```
#### First Time Dash Setup 

Follow Amazon's instructions to configure your button to send messages when you push them but not actually order anything. When you get a Dash button, Amazon gives you a list of setup instructions to get going. Just follow this list of instructions, but don’t complete the final step (#3 I think) **Do not select a product, just exit the app**.

#### Find a Dash
To find a dash on your network, run the following from the node-dash-button directory in node_modules:
``` sh
# you may need to use sudo due to libpcap running in permiscuous mode
$ cd node_modules/node-dash-button
$ node bin/findbutton
```

It will watch for new arp requests on your network.  There may be several arp requests, so press it a few times to make sure. Copy the hardware address as shown below

#### Example Usage:

For a single dash
``` js
//warning this may trigger multiple times for one press
//...usually triggers twice based on testing for each press
dash_button = require('node-dash-button');
var dash = dash_button("8f:3f:20:33:54:44"); //address from step above
dash.on("detected", function (){
	console.log("omg found");
});
```

For multiple dashes:
```js
dash_button = require('node-dash-button');
var dash = dash_button(["8f:3f:20:33:54:44","2e:3f:20:33:54:22"]); //address from step above
dash.on("detected", function (dash_id){
    if (dash_id === "8f:3f:20:33:54:44"){
        console.log("omg found");
    } else if (dash_id === "2e:3f:20:33:54:22"){
        console.log("found the other!");
    }
});
```

#### Running Tests:
Due to the use of pcap permiscuous monitoring this was difficult to test in CI environments, so I ended up making two testing suites.  One uses the live pcap library and does actual packet capturing/arp injections.  The other uses [mockery](https://github.com/mfncooper/mockery) to fake pcap packets.  I will have an upcoming blog post on how I did this, because it was interesting.

To run a live test of the code (requiring root due to permiscuous access please run).
```
sudo npm run-script livetest
```
This will actually inject ARP packets to the network to run the tests to ensure detection.

I wanted to use various CI tools that would not allow the pcap functions to work, so I ended up mocking their functions.  To run the mock tests use:
```
npm test
```


#### Example Projects:
I collected a few examples I found on github of how people are using this module, some projects are more mature than others
- [PizzaDash](https://github.com/bhberson/pizzadash) uses a node dash to order Domino's pizza. [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/28/9407669/amazon-dash-button-hack-pizza), [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/an-american-hero-hacked-an-amazon-dash-button-to-order-1733347471) and [Grubstreet](http://www.grubstreet.com/2015/09/amazon-dash-button-dominos-hack.html#)  did short writeups on the PizzaDash project].  
- [dashgong](https://github.com/danboy/dashgong) uses the node dash to send a message to slack
- [dash-listener](https://github.com/dkordik/dash-listener) performs various home automation tasks like adjusting lights and interacting with a music player
- [Nest-Dash](https://github.com/djrausch/Nest-Dash) toggles the Nest setting from away to home via Amazon Dash Button
- [dash-hipchat-doorbell](https://github.com/Sfeinste/dash-hipchat-doorbell) quick and dirty node app that intercepts traffic from an amazon dash button and creates a hipchat notification (think doorbell)
- [netflixandchill](https://github.com/sidho/netflixandchill) button to netflix and chill, dims the lights (no interface with netflix yet)
- [dash-rickroll](https://github.com/girliemac/dash-rickroll/blob/8f0396c7fec871427fe016a2dd5787f07b1402cc/README.md) title explains it all
