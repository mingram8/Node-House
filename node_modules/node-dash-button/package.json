I am using the same strategy of watching for dash generated ARP requests as the article above.\n\n### Contents\n-----------------\n- [Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions)\n- [First Time Dash Setup](#first-time-dash-setup)\n- [Find a Dash](#find-a-dash)\n- [Example Usage](#example-usage)\n- [Example Projects](#example-projects)\n- [Running Tests](#running-tests)\n- [To do](#to-do)\n- [Contributions](#contributions)\n- [License](#license)\n \n#### Installation Instructions\nThe following should work for ubuntu, the main thing for any os is getting the libpcap dependancy.\n``` sh\n# dependancy on libpcap for reading packets\n$ sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev\n$ npm install node-dash-button \n```\n#### First Time Dash Setup \n\nFollow Amazon's instructions to configure your button to send messages when you push them but not actually order anything. When you get a Dash button, Amazon gives you a list of setup instructions to get going. Just follow this list of instructions, but don’t complete the final step (#3 I think) **Do not select a product, just exit the app**.\n\n#### Find a Dash\nTo find a dash on your network, run the following from the node-dash-button directory in node_modules:\n``` sh\n# you may need to use sudo due to libpcap running in permiscuous mode\n$ cd node_modules/node-dash-button\n$ node bin/findbutton\n```\n\nIt will watch for new arp requests on your network.  There may be several arp requests, so press it a few times to make sure. Copy the hardware address as shown below\n\n![hw address](http://i.imgur.com/BngokPC.png)\n\n#### Example Usage:\n\nFor a single dash\n``` js\n//warning this may trigger multiple times for one press\n//...usually triggers twice based on testing for each press\ndash_button = require('node-dash-button');\nvar dash = dash_button(\"8f:3f:20:33:54:44\"); //address from step above\ndash.on(\"detected\", function (){\n\tconsole.log(\"omg found\");\n});\n```\n\nFor multiple dashes:\n```js\ndash_button = require('node-dash-button');\nvar dash = dash_button([\"8f:3f:20:33:54:44\",\"2e:3f:20:33:54:22\"]); //address from step above\ndash.on(\"detected\", function (dash_id){\n    if (dash_id === \"8f:3f:20:33:54:44\"){\n        console.log(\"omg found\");\n    } else if (dash_id === \"2e:3f:20:33:54:22\"){\n        console.log(\"found the other!\");\n    }\n});\n```\n\n#### Running Tests:\nDue to the use of pcap permiscuous monitoring this was difficult to test in CI environments, so I ended up making two testing suites.  One uses the live pcap library and does actual packet capturing/arp injections.  The other uses [mockery](https://github.com/mfncooper/mockery) to fake pcap packets.  I will have an upcoming blog post on how I did this, because it was interesting.\n\nTo run a live test of the code (requiring root due to permiscuous access please run).\n```\nsudo npm run-script livetest\n```\nThis will actually inject ARP packets to the network to run the tests to ensure detection.\n\nI wanted to use various CI tools that would not allow the pcap functions to work, so I ended up mocking their functions.  To run the mock tests use:\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\n\n#### Example Projects:\nI collected a few examples I found on github of how people are using this module, some projects are more mature than others\n- [PizzaDash](https://github.com/bhberson/pizzadash) uses a node dash to order Domino's pizza. [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/28/9407669/amazon-dash-button-hack-pizza), [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/an-american-hero-hacked-an-amazon-dash-button-to-order-1733347471) and [Grubstreet](http://www.grubstreet.com/2015/09/amazon-dash-button-dominos-hack.html#)  did short writeups on the PizzaDash project].  \n- [dashgong](https://github.com/danboy/dashgong) uses the node dash to send a message to slack\n- [dash-listener](https://github.com/dkordik/dash-listener) performs various home automation tasks like adjusting lights and interacting with a music player\n- [Nest-Dash](https://github.com/djrausch/Nest-Dash) toggles the Nest setting from away to home via Amazon Dash Button\n- [dash-hipchat-doorbell](https://github.com/Sfeinste/dash-hipchat-doorbell) quick and dirty node app that intercepts traffic from an amazon dash button and creates a hipchat notification (think doorbell)\n- [netflixandchill](https://github.com/sidho/netflixandchill) button to netflix and chill, dims the lights (no interface with netflix yet)\n- [dash-rickroll](https://github.com/girliemac/dash-rickroll/blob/8f0396c7fec871427fe016a2dd5787f07b1402cc/README.md) title explains it all \n\n#### To do\n- refactor\n\n#### Contributions\nAccepting pull requests!\n\n#### License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Alex Hortin\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
